      <p>Throughout the 10-year NIS ITA programme a series of regular
      peer reviews were carried out, with a senior panel of independent
      peer reviewers comprised of external academic, industry and government
      experts with deep experience in fields relevant to the NIS-ITA research.
      The peer reviewers consistently found the programme to be well aligned
      with the stated goals, collaborating deeply and creating great scientific
      results. The peer reviewers frequently gave constructive advice that
      enhanced the overall programme.
      </p>
      <p>The formal peer review was done every year in first half of the program.
      In the second half of the program a formal peer review was held every
      other year with an informal peer review carried out in intermediate years.
      </p>
      <p>In their final report the peer reviewers identified that the NIS ITA
      programme had proven itself to be highly successful.  Specifically they
      stated that the NIS-ITA was <i>"...an outstanding example of true, deep
      and enduring International Research Collaboration..."</i> that has
      <i>"...significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in network and
      information science through multi-disciplinary research..."</i>.
