      <p>Throughout the 10-year duration of the NIS-ITA research programme
      quarterly reports were created for every project undertaken by the
      Consortium. The creation of these was led by the project champion for
      each of the projects with the material generated by each primary
      investigator involved in the work.  These reports were then reviewed by
      the Technical Area Leaders (TALs) on a quarterly basis, in time for the
      quarterly meeting of the CMC and for overall aggregation and reporting.
      </p>
      <p>This standard quarterly progress reports were in addition to the many
      regular additional documents generated as a result of the ongoing research,
      for example: journal and conference papers, workshops, technical reports,
      patents etc.
      </p>
      <p>Copies of these QPR documents for the entire duration of the
      programme can be found below.
